# Sentiment-Analysis---Product-Recommend-System


**Problem Statement:**

In e-commerce, providing personalized product recommendations is crucial for enhancing customer satisfaction. Traditional systems may not fully leverage customer reviews to improve recommendations. This project aims to develop a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) based recommendation system using Amazon Home and Kitchen review data. The goal is to recommend similar products and predict overall ratings based on sentiment analysis of reviews.

**Process:**

Data Collection: Extract and load customer reviews from Amazon's Home and Kitchen dataset.

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values and outliers.
Scale features to ensure equal contribution in distance calculations.
Encode categorical data and convert text to numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF.

Recommendation System:
Implement a k-NN algorithm to find similar products based on review data.
Generate recommendations for products with average ratings ranging from 3.87 to 4.71.

Sentiment Analysis:
Analyze review sentiments to refine product recommendations and predict overall ratings.

Evaluation:
Assess the performance of the recommendation system and sentiment analysis using metrics like accuracy and user satisfaction.

**Conclusion:**

The k-NN-based recommendation system successfully identifies and suggests similar products from Amazon's Home and Kitchen dataset, with ratings between 3.87 and 4.71. Integrating sentiment analysis further enhances the accuracy of recommendations by considering customer feedback. This approach provides more personalized product suggestions and improves overall user experience.
